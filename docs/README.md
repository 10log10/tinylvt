# TinyLVT Documentation (Raw Markdown)

These are the source files for TinyLVT's documentation. They are rendered in
the app at `/docs/*` and served as raw markdown at `/docs-source/*`.

Internal links (e.g., `[Currency Modes](/docs/currency)`) point to the rendered
UI routes, not these raw files.

## Files

- **getting-started.md** - Overview of TinyLVT and key concepts
- **currency.md** - Currency modes (Points Allowance, Distributed Clearing, etc.)
- **setup.md** - Creating communities, sites, spaces, and running auctions
- **auctions.md** - How simultaneous ascending auctions and proxy bidding work
