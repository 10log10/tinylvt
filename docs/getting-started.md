# Getting Started with TinyLVT

TinyLVT helps communities allocate shared spaces fairly through
**auction-based allocation**.

## How It Works

1. Communities create **sites** with multiple **spaces**
2. During periodic auctions, members bid on spaces they want to use
3. The auction ensures fair pricing based on actual demand
4. Auction proceeds can be redistributed to achieve common ownership

## Key Concepts

### Simultaneous Ascending Auctions

All spaces in a site are auctioned together, with prices rising incrementally.
This format—used for high-stakes allocations like wireless spectrum—ensures
efficient allocation: spaces go to those who value them most, and winners pay
only what's needed to outbid others.

### Proxy Bidding

Most bidders have simple preferences. Rather than watching the auction in
real-time, you can enter your maximum values up front and let the system bid
for you automatically.

### Currency Modes

TinyLVT supports multiple ways to handle auction payments—from internal points
(no real money) to IOUs between members to prepaid credits. The currency mode
you choose determines whether your community operates as a common-ownership
collective or something closer to a traditional rental market.

**Important:** Currency mode cannot be changed after creating a community.

## Next Steps

1. **[Currency Modes](/docs/currency)** — Understand your options before
   creating a community
2. **[Community Setup](/docs/setup)** — Create your community, sites, and
   spaces
3. **[Auctions](/docs/auctions)** — Learn how bidding and allocation work
