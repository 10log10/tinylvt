# TinyLVT

> Auction-based allocation for shared spaces using land value taxation principles.

TinyLVT helps communities allocate shared spaces fairly through simultaneous
ascending auctions. It supports multiple currency modes for different ownership
models, from internal points to true common ownership with rent redistribution.

## Key Concepts

- **Simultaneous Ascending Auctions** - All spaces auctioned together with
  rising prices, used for high-stakes allocations like wireless spectrum
- **Proxy Bidding** - Enter maximum values upfront, system bids automatically
- **Currency Modes** - Points Allowance, Distributed Clearing, Deferred Payment,
  or Prepaid Credits (cannot be changed after community creation)
- **Distributed Clearing** - True common ownership where auction proceeds are
  split equally among all active members
